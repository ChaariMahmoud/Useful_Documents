##This guide shows how to move your Home folder to a separate partition (or location).

#Step 1:Creating a New Partition

Note: you can skip this step if you already have an existing external partition with enough space that you can use.
To create a new partition, you have to first create a bootable USB thumb drive or optical disc with Ubuntu on it
Boot from the bootabale USB and use Gparted to create Ext4 partition
After creating the new Home partition boot from your system

#Step 2:Migrate the Home Folder

1)Create a Temporary Home Folder:
  Open your file system table file : sudo nano /etc/fstab
  Add the following line to the end of the file: /dev/sdxx   /media/home    ext4          nodev,nosuid       0   
  (Use tab to create spaces in the line )  
  (Remember to replace “sdxx” with the partition label you wrote down earlier.)
  Create a mount point : sudo mkdir /media/home
  Reload the updated file system table : sudo mount -a

2)Copy the Files from Your Current Home Folder to the New Partition :
  sudo rsync -aXS --progress /home/. /media/home/.

3)Relocate the Current Home Folder:
  cd /
  sudo mv /home /home_backup
  sudo mkdir /home

4)Mount the New Home Folder:
  To complete the migration, mount the new Home folder as “/home” by revisiting the fstab file:
  sudo nano /etc/fstab
  Change “/media/home” to “/home”. Save and exit the file.
  sudo mount -a

#Step 3 :Remove the “Home_backup” Folder
Once you are done with the migration, you can either use the old Home folder as a backup or remove it to release the storage space. To remove it, use the command: sudo rm -rf /home_backup
