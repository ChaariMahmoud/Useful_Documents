##This is an installation guide for Arch-linux distribution
##You must follow these steps correctly to get a proper installation

##Section 1: Pre-installation 
Step 1 : Download the arch-linux iso file from https://archlinux.org/download/
Step 2 : Prepare an installation medium (You can use Balena-etcher or ventoy)
Step 3 : Disable Secure Boot (Arch Linux installation images do not support Secure Boot)
Step 4 : Boot the live environment 
Step 5 : Set the console keyboard layout (The default console keymap is US)
         You can change it to Azerty : localectl set-keymap fr
##Section 2: Configure wireless connexion
#You can skip this section if you are connected to wired connecxion 
Step 6 : Identify the wireless interface name with : ip addr show (In my case wlan0)
Step 7 : Show Wifi SSID :
         1) iwctl 
         2) station wlan0 get-networks 
         3) exit 
Step 8 : Connect to your wifi : iwctl --passphrase "your Wifi passphrase" staton wlan0 connect Your_wifi_SSID
##Section 3: Partition the disk
#The entire disk will be used in this section 
Step 9 : Identify the device identifier for the hard we want to use :lsblk (in my case we will use sda)
Step 10: Set up partitions 
         1) fdisk /dev/sda
         2) p (Display current partition layout)
         3) g (Create a new partition table !!This will wape the hard drive!!)
         #Create first partition
         1) n (Create the first partition) 
         2) Leave the partition number as default (1) by pressing enter 
         3) Leave the first sector as default by pressing enter 
         4) For the last sector type +1G and press enter 
         #Create the second partition 
         1) n (Create the second partition) 
         2) Leave the partition number as default (1) by pressing enter
         3) Leave the first sector as default by pressing enter 
         4) For the last sector type +1G and press enter
         #Create the root partition 
         1) n (Create the root partition)
         2) Leave the partition number as default (1) by pressing enter
         3) Leave the first sector as default by pressing enter
         4) Leave the last sector as default by pressing enter
         #Write changes to disk 
         1) p (Verify the creation of 3 partitions)
         2) w (Write changes to disk)
##Section 4: Format the partitions
Step 11 :Format the first partition to FAT32 filesystem : mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1
Step 12 :Format the second partition to ext4 filesyste : mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2
Step 13 :Format the root partition to ext4 filesystem : mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
#Section 5: Mount the second and root partitions 
Step 14 :Mount the root partition : mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
Step 15 :Create a new directory to mount the boot partition (partition 2) : mkdir /mnt/boot 
Step 16 :Mount the second partition : mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot
#Section 6: Install required packages for Arch-Linux
Step 17 :Install required packages : pacstrap -i /mnt base
        (If you have problem with signatures : pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring)
#Section 7: Generate the fstab file 
Step 18 : Generate the fstab file : genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
